Bitzy adds basic pre-hardmode gear based off of a game I made called... Bitzy. Armor, Wings, Tools, and Weapons, are added into the game with this mod.

ChangeLog:

v0.4:
Added the Bitzy Gun - A ranged weapon which shoots Bitzy Bullets. These bullets home in on enemies, simular to chlorophyte bullets.
The Bitzy Gun is stil a WIP weapon, and will recieve many changes in the future.

v0.3:
Added Bitzy Souls, which are used to craft the Bitzy Armor. These are obtainable post King-Slime.

Added a sprite for Bitzy Soul.

The armor and wings are craftable with Bitzy Souls.

Buffed Wings a bit, but are still really bad considering they are pre-hardmode.

Armor now has simular stats to crimson armor, with a few benefits.

v0.2:
The first version published. Adds many of the items. Only the wings are obtainable at this point.
